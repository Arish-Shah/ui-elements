          Sage creates safety for herself and her team wherever she goes. Able
          to revive fallen friends and stave off forceful assaults, she provides
          a calm center to a hellish battlefield.

          The most prominent support character to date hails from China and
          brings orbs that heal allies, slow enemies, and create barriers out of
          the ground to impede the flow of a match. Her ultimate ability allows
          her to resurrect a fallen ally,which is significant in a game with no
          respawns.
